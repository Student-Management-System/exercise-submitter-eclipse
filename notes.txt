Submit:
1) clear markers created by the exercise submitter for the selected project (see Clear Problem Markers)
2) check if there are any errors/warnings for the selected project
	- if there are, show a dialog "there are open errors/warnings. continue?"
	- user can cancel here
3) show dialog that allows to select an assignment in SUBMISSION state
	- show info dialog if currently on assignments are in SUBMISSION state
4) submit the selected project to the selected assignment
5) if result contains problems: add markers
6) display a result dialog
	- on success:
		- a big green check mark
		- "Your project $PROJECT_NAME was successfully submitted to $ASSIGNMENT_NAME."
		- if problems are found: "$NUM_PROBLEMS were found in your submission. Problem markers were added to your project"
	- failure:
		- a big red cross
		- "The project was NOT submitted."
		- if submission itself failed (e.g. exception): "The submission failed." (try to add good error messages here)
		- if submission succeeded but was simply rejected: "$NUM_PROBLEMS were found in your submission. Problem markers were added to your project"


Check Submission:
1) show dialog that allows to select an assignment in SUBMISSION state
2) Show an info dialog:
	- date of the last submission to the assignment
	- whether the contents of the submission are the same as the selected project
		- TBD
	- list of timestamps of all submissions
3) show user the following options:
	- close dialog without further action
	- if project and submission differ: submit the selected project to the selected assignment
	- if project and submission differ: download the last submission of the selected assignment (see Download Submission)


Clear Problem Markers:
- clears all markers created by the exercise submitter for the selected project


Show Assignments:
- shows an info dialog with all assignments, grouped by their current state
	- state SUBMISSION first


Download Submission:
1) show a dialog that allows to select an assignment in SUBMISSION or REVIEWED state
2) show a dialog that allows to select which revision to download
	- "download last submitted version"
	- "download a different version"
		- list of timestamp and author of all submissions
		- allows to select one
3) create a new project with the contents of the selected submission version
	- Project name: AssignmentName_2021-05-28_17-32
		- alternatively: let user enter a project name, maybe with this pre-filled
	- show a warning dialog if project already exists; clear contents if approved, abort otherwise
	- show an info dialog:
		"Submission is stored in project $PROJECT_NAME. You can delete the project after you are done via right-click -> Delete."


Configure:
- open the configuration dialog in the preferences


Help:
- show an info dialog with:
	- the version
	- a manual? maybe just a link to an online manual?




Future ideas:
- allow tutors to submit even if not in SUBMISSION state
